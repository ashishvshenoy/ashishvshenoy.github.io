Every user on the internet today is faced with an overwhelming set of
choices on almost every website he/she visits. Be it Facebook, Spotify,
Amazon or Google, there is a need to filter, rank and deliver relevant
information quickly in order to alleviate the problem of information

these days to solve this problem by searching through a large volume of
dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized
content and services. See Figure 1.[1](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~i385q/readings/Balabanovic_Shoham-1997-Fab.pdf)
