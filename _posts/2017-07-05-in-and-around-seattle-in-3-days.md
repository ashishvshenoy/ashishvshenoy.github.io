So you are in Seattle for a long weekend, here's what you should do.
## Reserve a rental car

Reserve rental cars through Sixt or Enterprise online. Start the reservation early morning arouond 8-ish and pick up the car from Pike Place Market. This location is well connected by buses, the link rail and the Seattle streetcar. Check with your employer if you get any discounts. (PS : I prefer Sixt as they have amazing collection of luxury cars)

## Head down to Snoqualmie falls
